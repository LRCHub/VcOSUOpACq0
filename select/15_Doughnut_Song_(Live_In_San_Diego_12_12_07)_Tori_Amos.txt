Had me a trick and a kick and your message
You'll never gain weight from a doughnut hole
Then thought that I could decipher your message
There's no one here dear no one at all

And if I'm wasting all your time this time
Maybe you never learned to take
And if I'm hanging on to your shade
I guess I'm way beyond the pale

And southern men can grow gold can grow pertty
Blood can be pertty like a delicate man
Copper to steel to a hinge that is faltered
That lets you in lets you in lets you in

Voice 1:
You can tell me, it's over, it's over
You can tell me, over and over your shoulder
You can tell me, it's over, over and over
Come in Houston

Voice 2:
And if I'm wasting all your time this time
I guess you never learned to take
And if I'm hanging on to your shade
I guess I'm way beyond the pale

Something's just
Something's just keeping you numb

You told me last night you were a sun now
With your very own devoted satellite
Happy for you and I am sure that I hate you
Two sons too many too many able fires

Voice 1:
You've been wasting my time this time
I said you never learned to take
And if I'm hanging on to your shade
I guess I'm way beyond the pale
I guess I'm way beyond the pale

Voice 2:
You can tell me, it's over, it's over
You can tell me, over and over your shoulder

Had me a trick and a kick and your message
You'll never gain weight from a doughnut hole
